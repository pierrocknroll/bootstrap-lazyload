# bootstrap-lazyload
Lazy loading of images in Twitter's Bootstrap Accordion and Carousel

Follow theses steps :
- Image attributes : class 'js-lazy-load' and replace src by data-lazyloadsrc.
- Of course, don't do this to the first one. For the carousel, I also prefer not to lazy load the second and the last one.
